"""
Preprocess templatized asset files, enabling asset authors to use
Python/Django inside of Sass and CoffeeScript. This preprocessing
will happen before the invocation of the asset compiler (currently
handled by the assets paver file).

For this to work, assets need to be named with the appropriate
template extension (e.g., .mako for Mako templates). Currently Mako
is the only template engine supported.
